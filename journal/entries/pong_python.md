# pong game on python 

## objective 
- the objective of the game is to not let the ball bounce into your side and to try too mkae it bounce into the opponents
- there will be a score. First to 7 wins

## controls 
- P1 will use 'w' and 's' to move up and down P2 will use 'arrow up' and 'arrow down' to move up and down
- space bar pauses the game
## the process 
 
I had already made a pong game on javascript and my project was to make the python version of that. 

### what i learned 
- at first I was going to use pictures as the paddles and ball but i looked it up and there was a way to draw just like in JS
- Java script and python(with pygame) are very similar

## how to download
- download the file 
- download pygame by running this on the command line "pip install pygame"
- [here is a link to where you can download the game](https://github.com/Brukkahs/Brukkahs.github.io/blob/main/pong.js)
